# CS419-Raytracer
A raytracer built during my the Fall 2018 semester of UIUC's CS419: Production Computer Graphics. Built in C/C++, and it may support OpenCL (realtime mobile raytracing?) given time constraints.

## Setup

I followed these instructions [here](https://rageandqq.github.io/blog/2018/03/09/opencl-mac-cpp.html) and used [this code sample](from https://gist.github.com/ddemidov/2925717) to get OpenCL working.

I ran into some issues during this, but I was able to get this working after installing a new version of g++ through Homebrew.

I am using SDL for drawing graphics. You can use the steps [here](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/mac/index.php) to setup SDL on MacOS.
