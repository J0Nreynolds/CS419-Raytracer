4. Sample code from Ray Tracing from the Ground Up
Most of the code in this project is my own, but I do borrow some fully implemented
pieces of code for classes I don't think are worth rewriting, such as most of the
Utilities (Vector3D, Point3D, etc.). I made sure to leave the copyright notice
on any files I haven't modified, so it should be easy to tell. In general, I base
most of my personal implementations off of the sample code/pseudocode/theory
discussed in the textbook.
